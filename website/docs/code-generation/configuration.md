# Configuration

> Driver specific configuration option and instructions can be found on their individual pages.

Configuration is done in a `bobgen.yaml` file in the same directory. A different configuration file can be passed with the `-c` or `--config` flag.

The configuration is marshalled in to the [Config struct](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stephenafamo/bob/gen#Config).

```go
// Config for the running of the commands
type Config struct {
	// Struct tags to generate
	Tags []string `yaml:"tags"`
	// Disable generating factory for models.
	NoFactory bool `yaml:"no_factory"`
	// Disable back referencing in the loaded relationship structs
	NoBackReferencing bool `yaml:"no_back_referencing"`
	// Delete the output folder (rm -rf) before generation to ensure sanity
	Wipe bool `yaml:"wipe"`
	// Decides the casing for go structure tag names. camel, title or snake (default snake)
	StructTagCasing string `yaml:"struct_tag_casing"`
	// Relationship struct tag name
	RelationTag string `yaml:"relation_tag"`
	// List of column names that should have tags values set to '-' (ignored during parsing)
	TagIgnore []string `yaml:"tag_ignore"`

	Aliases       Aliases       `yaml:"aliases"`       // customize aliases
	Constraints   Constraints   `yaml:"constraints"`   // define additional constraints
	Relationships Relationships `yaml:"relationships"` // define additional relationships

	Replacements []Replace   `yaml:"replacements"`
	Inflections  Inflections `yaml:"inflections"`

	// Customize the generator name in the top level comment of generated files
	// >>   Code generated by **GENERATOR NAME**. DO NOT EDIT.
	// defaults to "BobGen [driver] [version]"
	Generator string `yaml:"generator"`
}

## Aliases

Names are automatically generated for you. If you name your database entities properly you will likely have descriptive names generated in the end. However in the case where the names in your database are bad AND unchangeable, or bob's inference doesn't understand the names you do have (even though they are good and correct) you can use aliases to change the name of your tables, columns and relationships in the generated Go code.

_Note: It is not required to provide all parts of all names. Anything left out will be inferred by default._

```yaml
# Although team_names works fine without configuration, we use it here for illustrative purposes
aliases:
  team_names:
    up_plural: "TeamNames"
    up_singular: "TeamName"
    down_plural: "teamNames"
    down_singular: "teamName"
    columns: # Columns can be aliased by name
      uuid: "ID"
    relationships: # Relationships can be aliased by name
      team_id_fkey: "Owner"
```

## Replacements

There exists the ability to override types that the driver has inferred. The way to accomplish this is through the config file.

```yaml
replacements:
  - tables: ["table_name"] # What tables to look inside. Matches all tables if empty

    # The match is a drivers.Column struct, and matches on almost all fields.
    # Notable exception for the unique bool. Matches are done
    # with "logical and" meaning it must match all specified matchers.
    # Boolean values are only checked if all the string specifiers match first,
    # and they must always match.
    #
    # Note there is precedence for types.match, more specific things should appear
    # further down in the config as once a matching rule is found it is executed
    # immediately.
    match:
      name: "username" # Matches the column name
      db_type: "varchar(255)" # Matches the database type
      default: "NULL" # Matches the default value
      comment: "The username" # Matches the column comment
      nullable: true # Matches the nullable value. Defaults to false.
      generated: false # Matches the generated value. Defaults to false.
      autoincr: false # Matches the autoincr value. Defaults to false.

    # The replace is what we replace the strings with. You cannot modify any
    # boolean values in here. But we could change the Go type (the most useful thing)
    # or the DBType or FullDBType etc. if for some reason we needed to.
    replace:
      type: "mynull.String"
      imports: ['"github.com/me/mynull"']
```

## Constraints

It is possible to manually define additional constraints for your database. This is particularly useful if your database system or driver does not support constraints

This can also be used to create relationships since those are derived from foreign key constraints.

```yaml
constraints:
  pilots:
    primary: # This will overwirte any existing primary key on the table
      name: "pilots_pkey"
      columns: [id]
    uniques: # These will be added to existing unique constraints
      - name: "pilot_name_unique"
        columns: [name]
      - name: "pilot_nickname_unique"
        columns: [nickname]
    foreign: # These will be added to existing foreign constraints
      - name: "pilot_to_jets"
        columns: [id]
        foreign_table: "jets"
        foreign_columns: [pilot_id]
```

## Relationships

Relationships are automatically inferred from foreign key constraints. However, in certain cases, it is either not possible or not desireable to add a foreign key relationship.

We can manually describe relationships in the configuration:

```yaml
relationships:
  users: # The table name
    - name: "custom_videos_relationship" # A unique identifier used to configure aliases
      sides:
        - from: "users" # Name of the source of the relationship
          to: "videos" # Table name of the other side of the relation
          # mapping of columns from source to destination
          columns:
            - [id, user_id]

          # Which side to modify, "from" or "to"
          # If not set, it will try to "guess" which side to modify
          # - if only one of the sides contains a primary key,
          #   it will choose to modify the other side
          # - If (both or none) of them contains a primary key,
          #   it will try with "Unique" columns
          # - If it still cannot choose, it defaults to "to"
          modify: "" | from" | "to"
```

### Related Through

The configuration also allows us to describe relationships that span multiple tables. We achieve this by having multiple `sides`.

In this example configuration, we add a relationship of users to videos through teams. The generated user model with have a `Videos` relation.

```yaml
relationships:
  users:
    - name: "users_to_videos_through_teams"
      sides:
        - from: "users"
          to: "teams"
          columns: [[team_id, id]]
        - from: "teams"
          to: "videos"
          columns: [[id, team_id]]
```

### Related Where

The configuration also allows us to describe relationships that are not only based on matching columns but also columns with static values. For example, we may want to add a relationship to teams for verified members.

```yaml
relationships:
  users:
    - name: "users_to_videos_through_teams"
      sides:
        - from: "teams"
          to: "users"
          columns: [[id, team_id]]
          to_where:
            - column: "verified"
              value: "true"
```

## Inflections

With inflections, you can control the rules used to generate singular/plural variants. This is useful if a certain word or suffix is used multiple times and you do not wnat to create aliases for every instance.

```yaml
inflections:
  plural: # Rules to convert a suffix to its plural form
    ium: ia
  plural_exact: # Rul
```
